Here I will be using Dynamic Programming to to determine which metro areas to purchase house in assume we can only buy a single house in each city. 
We are given 1 million dollars to spend. Our DP algorithm should tell us how much estimated profit we will make, along with
a list of the city names of our purchases.

Since 1 million dollars will create a table with one huge dimension and houses usually arenâ€™t bought
down to the dollar, we will add a variable to our function that tell the smallest increment the dollar amount can have.
